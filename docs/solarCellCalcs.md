# solar cell calculations

## Outer
* Each side has 18 facets so the angle at the centre is 20 degrees (20*18 = 360)

Side a = 200
Side b = 200
Side c = 69.45927

Angle ∠A = 80° = 1.39626 rad = 4/9π
Angle ∠B = 80° = 1.39626 rad = 4/9π
Angle ∠C = 20° = 0.34907 rad = π/9

* the square across the circumference is 69.459mm


## inner
what size is the inner circle, given the panels are 55mm across

* Each side has 18 facets
* the square across has to be 55mm

Side a = 158.36619
Side b = 158.36619
Side c = 55

Angle ∠A = 80° = 1.39626 rad = 4/9π
Angle ∠B = 80° = 1.39626 rad = 4/9π
Angle ∠C = 20° = 0.34907 rad = π/9

* therefore the inner radius is 158.366

Side a = 158.366
Side b = 110
Side c = 200

Angle ∠A = 52.114° = 52°6'50" = 0.90956 rad
Angle ∠B = 33.243° = 33°14'36" = 0.5802 rad
Angle ∠C = 94.643° = 94°38'35" = 1.65183 rad

* so the bottom angle is 52.1 degrees and the top is 94.64 to the centre

* each large facet is 69.459 and the panel is 55 leaving 14.459 or 7.22 each side
* if the distance between the panels is 14.459mm then the 

Side a = 110
Side b = 110
Side c = 14.459

Angle ∠A = 86.232° = 86°13'54" = 1.50503 rad
Angle ∠B = 86.232° = 86°13'54" = 1.50503 rad
Angle ∠C = 7.537° = 7°32'12" = 0.13154 rad

* the angle between the panels is 7.53 degrees at the top
