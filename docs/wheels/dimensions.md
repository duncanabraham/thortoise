# Wheel dimensions

6" or 146mm Trolley wheel with 1/2" bore.



Image analysis:

Bore = 102 pixels
Width = 1108 pixels

Check image against dimensions:
146mm = 1108, therefore 1mm = 7.5 pixels
102 / 7.5 = 13.6mm

if 102 = 12.7mm therefore 1mm = 8 pixels per mm
1108 / 8 = 138.5mm

so it's somewhere between 7.5 and 8 pixels per mm, lets call it 7.75
