A list of design decisions that have come about during the development that have altered the intended implementation


1) NO GPS
After looking into the accuracy of the GPS signal, +-2.5 metres on a good day and double that on a bad one, it doesn't really fit the navigation requirements
of Thortoise which will need to map the available space to an accuracy of 200mm.

Maybe one to revisit in the future if the technology improves.



2) MAPPING IN 2D
Originally, because the robot can only move on a 2d plane, the intention was to map the world as a 2d grid.  As I've got into this and considered the
information coming from the Oak-D Lite camera, which will return points in 3 dimensions, I'm updating the Map (World) and the navigation calculations
to allow the robot to operate in a 3d world.

For now this will be a fixed box model world as it's operating environment will be confined to my garden, but in future I'd like to develop the map in
a MineCraft way to allow it to grow to fit the environment.


3) 3D BROWSER VIEW
Having had a little play with BABYLON.js I'm confident I can render the World of Thortoise as a 3D World that can be viewed and interacted with.
This provides a First Person view of the world and provides methods for moving the camera to view the scene from any part of the world.
